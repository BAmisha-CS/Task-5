# Task-5
Network Traffic Capture and Protocol Analysis with Wireshark

Task Description
In this task, I used Wireshark to capture and analyze live network traffic on my computer. The goal was to monitor the data packets transmitted over the network, identify various protocols involved, and save the captured data for further analysis.

What I Did
1. Starting Packet Capture
I launched Wireshark and started capturing packets on my active network interface â€” the network adapter currently handling my internet traffic (e.g., Wi-Fi). This allowed Wireshark to intercept and log all network packets sent and received by my system.

2. Generating Network Traffic
To generate real network traffic, I browsed websites and pinged servers, which resulted in a variety of protocols being captured including:

HTTP: Unencrypted web traffic from websites that still use HTTP.
TCP: Transport layer packets used by most network communications including HTTP and QUIC.
UDP: Used by protocols like DNS and QUIC.
QUIC: A modern transport protocol (often used by HTTP/3) running over UDP, commonly seen on major websites.
DNS: Protocol responsible for resolving domain names to IP addresses.

3. Filtering by Protocol
Within Wireshark, I used display filters such as http, tcp, udp, quic, and dns to isolate and analyze packets of specific protocols. This helped me understand the different types of communication happening on my network.

4. Stopping and Saving the Capture
After capturing network traffic for approximately one minute, I stopped the capture session in Wireshark. I then saved the entire capture file as a .pcap file, which is a standard format for packet captures. This file can be reopened later in Wireshark or used with other network analysis tools.

Why This Matters
Capturing and analyzing network traffic helps in:
Understanding how devices communicate over the internet.
Troubleshooting network issues.
Learning about different network protocols and their roles.
Monitoring for suspicious or unwanted network activity.

How to Reproduce This
Install Wireshark from https://www.wireshark.org/.
Open Wireshark and start a new capture on your active network interface.
Generate traffic by browsing the internet or pinging a server.
After capturing for a minute, stop the capture.
Save the capture file as a .pcap file for analysis.
